# Indian Startup Intelligence

A modular analytics platform for exploring India's startup funding ecosystem through interactive dashboards, startup analytics, and investor intelligence.

The application is built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Plotly**, following a layered architecture that separates the user interface, application logic, analytics engine, and data processing components. The architecture is designed to support future AI-powered analytics through Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
